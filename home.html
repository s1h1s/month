<p> A travel agency is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism-related services to the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers to offer different kinds of travelling packages for each destination. Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, VIP airport lounge access, arranging logistics for luggage and medical items delivery for travellers upon request, public transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They do not keep inventory in-hand unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or other group event.</p>

<p> Booking Holdings and Expedia Group, both online travel agencies, are the largest travel agencies on the list of top earning travel companies.[11] Travel agencies can be multinational companies, referred to as "multiples" in the United Kingdom. They can also be medium-sized organizations, referred to as "miniples" in the United Kingdom, or can be independent, small companies. They can be structured as a limited liability company, a sole proprietorship, or can be set up as a host, franchising, or consortium structure, such as in the case of CWT. A traditional travel agent may work for a travel agency or work freelance.[12][13][14][15] Helloworld Travel is an example of a franchised travel agency, giving agents access to internal systems for product and bookings.[16] While most point-to-point travel is now booked online, traditional agents specialize in niche markets such as corporate travel, luxury travel, cruises, complicated and important trips, and specialty trips.[17] Other niche markets include travelers with disabilities, travelers over the age of 60, women traveling alone, LGBT tourism,[18] the needs of residents in an upmarket commuter town or suburb, or a particular group interested in a similar activity, such as a sport.[19][20][21] Examples include StudentUniverse and STA Travel, which specialize in youth travel, or CWT, which caters to corporate travel. Many use telecommuting to reduce overhead or provide concierge services. Agents can act as "travel consultants" with flawless knowledge of destination regions and specialize in topics like nautical tourism or cultural tourism.[22] Many traditional agents prefer the term "travel advisor" as opposed to "travel agent" to emphasize their advice, expertise, and connections that are of great value.[23] There are also direct-to-local booking agencies that connect users with travel experts in the country they plan to visit instead of travel agents in their country of residence. [24][25][26]Outbound travel agencies offer multi-destinations; inbound travel agencies are based in the destination and deliver an expertise on that location.[27]</p>
